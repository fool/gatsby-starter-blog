### Milepost 96 

It had been a rainy night in camp, but my tent stayed dry inside, despite being pitched poorly (as I discovered when breaking it down in the morning and finding a puddle on the ground cloth underneath where I slept).  Drying the tent pieces most of the way took about 2 hours in the cloudy still air.  But I got to spend it in the trees, and I like being in the trees (more than the coast, about on par with the mountains in my "spiritual nature experiences" rankings), so it wasn't bad.

I grazed on snacks for breakfast; now I am carrying 3/4 pound less of snack food.  Still plenty in reserve.

I thought I might have a short riding day, and I was right.  Overall the ride was pretty good - rural, but lots of low-traffic roads, or roads with shoulders and then even bike lanes as I made it into Bellingham.  Tried to make it a light day but my legs still hurt after, so I got some nice relaxation time in town since most of the ride was over by 1.

While riding I found 3 surprise "off-road" paths to the route today that weren't on the map, and I love surprise off-road excursions!  

1. First was barely visible on google maps, pointing almost straight away from the campground (which was a couple miles off the main route I'm following), pointed directly back towards the main route, so it was an easy choice.  Turned out to be land owned by BP, with a paved road through it, that was only open to pedestrians and bikes, for about 3 miles.  I saw a couple of walkers and a dog, but no real indication why BP owned the land.  There were refineries on the horizon, but it seemed like they were separated by a full public road from this huge parcel of shore-view property.  Anyway it was nice to bike on!
2. Was on the reservation which the route skirted the edge of.  It was a well-lit by solar-powered lights well engineered MUP that went along a road that was initially otherwise empty (it ended at a casino right at the edge of the reservation).  It wound into a bit of a settled area and then my route diverged from it.  Short but much appreciated on the side of the road with no shoulders and fairly steady traffic.

3. Was a short segment along the coast outside of Bellingham, gravel and shaded and on some empty land ending in a park where I got this picture:

At lunch I had a goal:  I craved a burger.  I let google help me find "brewpub with burger" and was not disappointed in the Chuckanut Brewery & Kitchen.  Good beer, very good burger, and the waitress helped me find a bike parking spot I could see from where I was eating, and then suggestively dropped this coaster along with my meal, so I knew I'd found an afternoon activity:

Not sure if you can see that, but it says "Bike Party on Bay Street, May 17th 4-7pm".  Or, 2 hours hence, 2 miles away.  How could I say no?

So, I checked into a cheap motel since camping in town can be really hit or miss (sketchy?  next to the highway?  actually 6 miles outside of town?), got cleaned up and then around 4:30 I wandered down to the Bike Party on Bay where I had a few beers, watched some folks race around on tricycles, and chatted with Mark who is a local who works for the city about local advocacy, nimbyism, bike facilities, and urban growth for an hour or so, found out about a bike polo tournament that night, and then had a very good grilled cheese sandwich for first dinner.

It didn't turn out to be filling, so as I walked around downtown Bellingham waiting til tournament time, I stopped at a Mexican place and got a torta.  It was only OK.  Then I found the tournament and it was still heavily under construction (they were building the court in a parking garage, putting up boards and netting).  Seeing as that wasn't super exciting to watch, I wandered home via random neighborhood streets that were sometimes secret bike routes and I found the "bikey pointies" (my new term for sharrows) got me most of the way to my destination.

Tomorrow I haven't figured out where I'll go, yet.  There's plenty of commerce and camping to the south though, so it should be fine.
