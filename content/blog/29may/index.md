### Milepost ~600

Every day on the bike is a good day, but some are better than others.

The weather was perfect - sunny and not too windy or warm, and since I knew I was not going very far and shouldn't arrive at the hotel before midafternoon, I took my time getting up and rolling, though once I was out of the tent, even after using mosquito repellent those jerks drove me through a hurried but still thorough departure, not forgetting sunscreen and/or pre-hydrating as I had in the recent past.

One of my favorite quotes from seeing the Dalai Lama speak was his answer to the question "What's the hardest thing for you about being a Buddhist?" and he thought for a moment before answering a single word: "Mosquitoes."

I had planned another small day, 20-30 miles.  I haven't really looked at my odometer since it reset, but my maps have consistent mileage markers between points of interest, so I always know "about" how far I'll go, but of course I also explore a bit so it's almost always a slightly smaller expectation than reality.  I was planning on breakfasting shortly on the way south from Newport, but since I was camping on the edge, I came across no convenient stops, so just rolled to one of many beach stops for a snack, then carried on ~20mi to bustling Waldport for brunch, where I consumed most of a pizza and took a chance to visit the grocery store to grab shaving supplies (I'd always assumed I would be near a grocery store if I wanted to clean up, and it turned out to be true!), and then glided onwards along the beach.  This bridge connected two halves of Waldport (population ~2,300) and was the least unpleasant car bridge I've crossed - almost all downhill and plenty of shoulder!

All day: yet more beach overlooks.  Sandy, Sunny, Cloudy, Windy, gorgeous, etc.  [Check out the photo gallery here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kcg4Dr3ZtwiL9hQz7)

While scenic-overlooking, I learned a lot about wildlife habitats and legal protections therefor during the last few days of stopping at every beach and linger, reading all the signs.  A bit of an inveterate plaque-reader, I am!  To summarize:

- messing with most of the wildlife in the tidepools is likely harmful and potentially fatal to them. Don't molest the starfish.
- the rocky outcroppings on the beach are largely protected by state law as wildlife preserves which you shouldn't enter or climb on.  Don't traumatize the birds.
- and of course there's the fun ["all beaches in oregon are public land" law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Beach_Bill) to factor in.  Do maybe stand nearby and stick your tongue out at the nearby property owners just a little bit - they aren't an endangered species :P

I'd done a bit of investigation of the immediate surroundings of my hotel destination (a place Lori went to as a kid and enjoys returning to), and found an MUP along the beach that isn't really part of the route, though it has been included in the [Oregon Coast Trail](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/parks/pages/oct_main.aspx).  In Yachats, this is called the ["804 trail"](https://www.oregonlive.com/travel/2016/07/hike_one_of_the_best_trail_sys.html) locally and while I'm no expert I can read between the lines of the signs about trail being on or abutting private property and a bench commemorating the "stewards of the 804 trail", and surmise that it was a hard-won battle.  What is most important right now is that it was quite a pleasant way to end the trip, with little super scenic bits like this even just in the last mile:

Cleaned up, watched the waves and read for a few hours, awaited Lori's arrival.  Together we ate dinner and went for a walk along the crashing coast and then snuggled to sleep and dreamed of nothing.

In the morning I drove us back to the part of the state where all the people are.  I'll come do part 2 (part 3?  First part between Mexico and Santa Barbara already ridden back in 2012-ish) someday.  Conveniently/Intentionally I stopped this journey in the town of Yachats which is as far south as you can easily get directly from Portland on a transit-type bus (rather than a Greyhound type).  More to come in this blog as I do a gear-checkout and some "Deeper Thoughts" I didn't make time to write down during the daily journals.
