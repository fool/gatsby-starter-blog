### Milepost ~600

Every day on the bike is a good day, but some are better than others.

The weather was perfect - sunny and not too windy or warm, and since I knew I was not going very far and shouldn't arrive at the hotel before midafternoon, I took my time getting up and rolling, though once I was out of the tent, even after using mosquito repellent the jerks drove me through a hurried but thorough departure, not forgetting sunscreen and pre-hydrating as I had done in the recent past.

One of my favorite quotes from seeing the Dalai Lama speak was his answer to the question "What's the hardest thing for you about being a Buddhist?" and he thought for a moment before answering a single word: "Mosquitoes."

I had planned another small day, 20-30 miles.  I haven't really looked at my odometer since it reset, but my maps have consistent mileage markers between points of interest, so I always know "about" how far I'll go.  I was thinking of breakfasting on the way south but saw no convenient stops, so just rolled to bustling waldport where I found most of a pizza and a chance to visit the grocery store to grab shaving supplies - I'd always assumed I would be near a grocery store if I wanted to clean up, and then glided onwards along the beach.

All day: yet more beach overlooks.  Sandy, Sunny, Cloudy, Windy, gorgeous, etc.  [Check out the photo gallery here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kcg4Dr3ZtwiL9hQz7)

learned a lot about wildlife and legal protections therefor during the last few days of stop at every beach and linger, reading all the signs.  A bit of an inveterate plaque-reader, I am!  To summarize:

- messing with most of the wildlife in the tidepools is likely harmful and potentially fatal to them
- the rocky outcroppings on the beach are largely protected by state law as wildlife preserves that you shouldn't enter
- and of course there's the fun ["all beaches in oregon are public land" law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Beach_Bill) to factor in.

I'd done a bit of investigation of the immediate surroundings of my hotel destination (a place Lori went to as a kid and enjoys returning to), and found a  This is called the "804 trail" locally and while I'm not sure why I can read between the lines of the signs about trail being on or abutting private property and a bench commemorating the "stewards of the 804 trail", and surmise that it was a hard-won battle.

Cleaned up, watched the waves and read for a few hours, awaited Lori's arrival.  Ate dinner and went for a walk along the crashing coast and then snuggled to sleep and dreamed of nothing.

In the morning I drove us back to the part of the state where all the people are.  I'll come do part 2 someday;  conveniently I stopped in the town of Yachats which is as far south as you can easily get directly from Portland on a transit-type bus (rather than a greyhound type).  More to come in this blog as I do a gear-checkout and some "Deeper Thoughts" I didn't make time to write down during the daily journals.
